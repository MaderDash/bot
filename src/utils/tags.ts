              "2.  **Input protection diodes:** Some chips have internal diodes that try to clamp excess voltage, but these are not designed for continuous operation outside specified limits and will eventually burn out.\n" +

However, using a bi-directional level shifter handles both directions cleanly and is good practice."

In most cases use a dedicated 3.3V regulator). Do NOT power a 3.3V module with 5V VCC unless its datasheet explicitly states it has an onboard regulator that can handle 5V input."
