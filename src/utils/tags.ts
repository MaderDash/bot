If you supply 9v then the you only have around 300mA, if you supply 12v then you will only have around 150mA. Keep this in mind as you work on your project. along with this the MCU that your useing has a max out put also. Example the UNO 328 IC can output 20mA per pin. it has 19 pins so that should be 380mA.
